# hello-world
This is a short description for the repository.

My name is Knikkolette Church.  I was born in a different country, adopted by an American family and raised in a tiny Oklahoma farm town.  I believe the challenges I faced growing up made me the person I am today.  I am someone who is always willing to help others, likes to be part of a team but is also able to work alone.  I always try to put myself in other people's shoes to see a conflict or situation from their viewpoint and think to myself, how would I feel or think in this same situation?
